# DWM---social-media-analytics

This repository contains a social media analytics project designed for deep data mining and analysis of user interactions, platform engagement, and incident tracking such as cyberbullying and scams.

## üìä Star Schema Overview

The database follows a **Star Schema** design, optimized for analytics and reporting. The schema consists of several fact and dimension tables to support efficient querying and aggregation.

### üü¶ Fact Tables

- **Interaction**: Stores data about user interactions with content (posts, likes, comments, etc.).
- **Content_Facts**: Aggregates facts about content posted on platforms.
- **User_Facts**: Aggregates user activity and engagement.
- **Cyber_Bullying/Scams Facts**: Records incidents of cyberbullying or scams.
- **reports**: Tracks individual reports of incidents.

### üü® Dimension Tables

- **User**: User information (user_id, user_name, age, gender).
- **Platform**: Platforms where interactions occur (platform_id, name, type).
- **Location**: Geographical location (location_id, country, state, city, pincode).
- **Time**: Date and time breakdown (seconds, year, month, quarter, season).
- **Content**: Content meta-data (content_id, creator, platform, type, etc.).
- **device**: User device details.
